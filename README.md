##Sudoku
Sudoku in Python with Backtracking
Sudoku is a brain challenging number game, played on a 9x9 sudoku board. The sudoku board is broken down into nine 3x3 squares. The object of the sudoku game is simple. Every row, column, and 3x3 box in the sudoku board must contain the digits 1 through 9 only once!

Backtracking: Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
